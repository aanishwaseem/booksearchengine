The study of data structures, a fundamental component of a computer science education,
serves as the foundation upon which many other computer science fields are built.
Some knowledge of data structures is a must for students who wish to do work in design,
implementation, testing, or maintenance of virtually any software system.
The scope and presentation of material in Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ provide students with the necessary knowledge to perform such work.

This book highlights three important aspects of data structures.
First, a very strong emphasis is placed on the connection between data structures and their algorithms,
including analyzing algorithms complexity. Second, data structures are presented in an object-oriented setting in accordance with the current design and
implementation paradigm. In particular, the information-hiding principle to advance encapsulation and decomposition is stressed.
Finally, an important component of the book is data structure implementation, which leads to the choice of C++ as the programming language.

The C++ language, an object-oriented descendant of C, is widespread in industry and academia as an excellent programming language.
It is also useful and natural for introducing data structures.
Therefore, because of the wide use of C++ in application programming
and the object-oriented characteristics of the language, using C++ to teach a data structures and algorithms course, even on the introductory level,
is well justified.

Most chapters include a case study that illustrates a complete context in which certain algorithms and data structures can be used.
These case studies were chosen from different areas of computer science such as interpreters, symbolic computation, and file processing
 to indicate the wide range of applications to which topics under discussion may apply.
